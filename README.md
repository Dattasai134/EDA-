Here’s a complete and clean **README.md** for your Bonus Allocation EDA project that you can paste into your GitHub repo:

## 🎯 Bonus Allocation – End-to-End EDA & Data Preprocessing Project

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing of a **Bonus Allocation dataset**. It provides insights into user betting behaviors, bonus distribution patterns, and engineered features that can support bonus decision-making logic.

---

### 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: Provided internally (Excel format)
* **Rows**: 5000
* **Columns**: 19
* **Target**: `Should_Receive_Bonus` (Binary classification – 1: Yes, 0: No)

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

---

### ✅ Objectives

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Analyze patterns in betting behavior
* Visualize trends and correlations
* Engineer new features for further modeling
* Prepare the cleaned dataset for ML or BI usage

---

### 🔍 Key Explorations

* Gender and Age distributions
* Top countries by user activity
* Relationship between betting activity and bonus outcomes
* Correlation heatmaps of all numerical features
* Feature importance intuition (like bonus-to-wager ratio)

---

### 🧹 Preprocessing Steps

* Dropped irrelevant columns (`customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`)
* Handled data types (e.g., converted gender and country to categorical)
* Checked and removed duplicates (if any)
* Engineered features:

  * `avg_bet_per_day`
  * `bonus_to_wager_ratio`

---

### 📊 Sample Visualizations

* Bonus Distribution by Gender
* Age Histogram with KDE
* Correlation Heatmap
* Country-wise User Distribution

---

### 📦 Outputs

* `cleaned_bonus_allocation.csv` – Cleaned and feature-engineered dataset
* Visual insights via plots (saved or displayed from notebook)

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
   ```
3. Run the notebook or Python script from `src/` or `notebook/` folder
4. Check cleaned dataset in `output/` folder
